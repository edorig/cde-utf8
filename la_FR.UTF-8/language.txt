0) Why a Latin translation
   ======================= 


Linux lacks a Latin locale due to decisions made by developpers of the C library who treat modern Latin as an artificial language on the same footing as Esperanto or Interlingua. This makes the creation of a Latin translation more difficult than in the case of even a regional language such as Occitan for which a local oc_FR already exists.
So that translation is useful 
to understand the steps to add support for a language in the C library (see file Installation).  


Also, the documentation that comes with CDE is a bit limited on the 
translation of messages. It explains mainly where to put translated files on the system, but it gives little description of the vocabulary used by the desktop. 
The translation in Latin yields a lexicon of terms frequently used by the desktop (see file latin3.txt) . Having such lexicon will help to make translations in more common languages. 

Currently, CDE lacks translations in 
- All Eastern European languages
- Vietnamese and Thai languages and all languages of India
- All African languages 
- Portuguese and Dutch 
- Basque, Corsican, Breton, Alsatian, Catalan (just for French regional languages) 

The current Latin translation, even if very imperfect should be viewed as a template for these more important translations. 

1) Spelling:
   ========

I use a modern spelling distinguishing 'i' from 'j' and 'u' from 'v',
and using uppercase and lowercase letters.
I don't use diacritic signs to distinguish long and short vowels, and
I also don't use ligatures. This is the result of limitations of
ISO8859-1 encoding: while all the letters of the modern latin alphabet are
represented, macron and other diacritic sign are not available in that
encoding. Moreover, while the æ Æ (AE) ligatures are available in
ISO-8859-1, the oe ligature is defined only in ISO8859-15, an extension
of ISO8859-1 that also provide the € (Euro) sign.

With UTF-8, adding ligatures and diacritic signs is possible. However, I have kept the ASCII compatible text so that there will be no difficulty to recreate a la_FR.ISO8859-1 locale if needed. 

2) Sources:
   =======

I have translated the French message catalog in Latin. For that
purpose, I used: 
   
Dictionnaire Français-Latin Henri Goelzer (1906)
Dictionnaire Français-Latin Louis Quicherat (Hachette,1858)
Dictionnaire Français-Latin-Chinois Paul Perny (Firmin-Didot,1869)

The first two are classical Latin dictionaries. The last one was
written by a Catholic priest living in China and is a French
(ecclesiastic) Latin Chinese dictionary. I have also used:

F. Gaffiot Dictionnaire Latin-Français (2016, electronic edition)
Dictionnaire Latin-Français Quicherat-Daveluy (Hachette, 1910)

to verify some translations. For modern latin, I used:

Le Latin sans peine C. Desessard (Assimil, 1966)
Lexicon Latinum David Morgan
(http://alpha.furman.edu/~dmorgan/lexicon/silva.htm)
Vocabula computatralia Konrad Kokoszkiewicz
(http://www.culturaclasica.com/lingualatina/vocabula_computatralia.pdf)
FJ Goebel Elementa, geometriae in usum praelectionum novo ordine
         digesta (for definitions of angle units)  pp. 138-139.

For grammar, I have used:
Grammaire Latine Ch. Maquet et M. Roger (Hachette, 1949)
Cours complet de grammaire latine E. Sommer (Hachette, 1872)

3) Style:
   =====

The computer is talking to the user using the second person
singular. If something must be done by the user, the computer
will use a present imperative. When the computer does something, it
uses the first person singular. General instructions are given using
an impersonal form (debet, oportet ...).

I have tried to avoid imprecisions by using a lexicon (see file
latin3.txt) so that the same words are used to describe the same
operations in all the Desktop applications. I have often recycled
parts of sentences in error messages that describe similar problems.

I have also tried to make the messages as simple and direct as I
could. Because of that, I may have used indicative mode where the
subjunctive mode is grammatically more correct.

4) Errors:
   =======

There are certainly plenty of errors in the translations. 
If you wish to send corrections, please follow the template: 

Program Name: (dtfile, dtcm, dtpad, dtinfo, etc...) 
Incorrect text: 
Type of error: grammatical (verb conjugation, declension, etc...) 
spelling (indicate wrong spelling and correct one) translation (indicate 
bad translation for the English word and correct one/ check file latin3.txt first) sentence that makes no sense. 
Faulty file: (if you can locate it, indicate path types/ app-defaults/ and filename)
