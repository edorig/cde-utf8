By default, the Chinese messages are not compiled and installed 
by the CDE build process. 
Using GNU gencat, it is possible to build post-installation the 
Chinese messages. However, the process is more complicated than
in the case of Korean or Japanese language. 
For traditional Chinese, the messages are under zh_TW.dt-euctw. 
With gencat, the messages can be turned into .cat files for the
zh_TW.euctw but installing the .cat files and using LANG=zh_TW.euctw 
only gives English messages. 
For simplified Chinese, there is no zh_CN.euccn locale on Linux. 
Instead, one must use the zh_CN locale, which is the closest to eucCN. 
Translating the messages 
------------------------

To proceed, some checks are necessary. 

First, make sure zh_CN locale is installed with

 locale -a |grep zh_CN 

If yes, check that the gb2312 fonts are present with 
 
 xlsfonts | grep gb2312 
 
The result of that command should show fonts such as 
-isas-song ti-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-c-160-gb2312.1980-0
 


Then copy catgen-zh.sh in a directory such as $HOME/bin and make it
executable 

 chmod +x $HOME/bin/catgen-zh.sh 
 cd $CDEROOT/programs/localized/zh_CN.dt-eucCN/msg 
 $HOME/bin/catgen-zh.sh 

The program will ask your password to copy the .cat files in the /usr/dt/lib/nls/msg
directory. This works on Ubuntu, but with Slackware or other systems not using
sudo you may need to remove the sudo command in the last line and become root
before running the script. 
Then, copy the font aliases file 

 sudo mkdir -p /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/  
 cp $CDEROOT/cdesktopenv-code/cde/programs/fontaliases/linux/zh_CN/fonts.alias /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/ 
 sudo echo "0" > /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CN/fonts.dir 

Once this is done, add the lines 
xset fp+ /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/ 
export LANG=zh_CN.gbk 

 to $HOME/.dtprofile and restart CDE. You should see the menus of applications
 and the window titles in Chinese. 
 
 Issues with fonts
 ------------------
 
 You may see instead of Chinese characters in the menus some garbled text 
formed of European characters. This indicates that CDE does not find appropriate
gb2312 fonts and falls back to iso8859-1. 

To solve that problem, one needs to modify the fonts.alias file 
in /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/ . 

One must have fonts in gb2312  encoding of sizes 10,12,14,16,18,20,24.
For each size xxs (10), xs (12), s (14), m (16), l (18), xl (20), xxl (24) 
one needs to alias the fonts of type 
-dt-interface user-*
-dt-interface system-*
-dt-interface terminal-*
in both medium and bold to the corresponding system font in gb2312 encoding. 

Then, the aliasing is done in the fonts.alias file by writing on the left the XLFD name
of the CDE font, on the right the appropriate XLFD name for the system font. 
One example is: 
   CDE font                                                                   Chinese system font
 "-dt-interface terminal-medium-r-normal-s-14-130-75-75-m-140-gb2312.1980-0" "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-gb2312.1980-0"
 
The file fonts.alias under /usr/dt/config/xfonts/sh_CN shows the pattern to follow. 

With the right bitmap fonts, the Chinese messages will become visible. 

An alternative untested solution would be to use OpenType Noto fonts via XFT 
https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/FontsWithXFT/

mkfontscale and mkfontdir should be used to create a XLFD name for these
fonts, then the dt-interface fonts should be aliased to these scalable fonts
using the XLFD name as above. This is more complicated than the bitmapped font solution
and should be tried only if the former fails.
