Messages 
========

By default, the Korean messages are not compiled and installed 
by the CDE build process. 
With GNU gencat, it is possible to build post-installation the 
Korean messages for the ko_KR.euckr locale and install them 
in the appropriate directory. With the right fonts, it should 
be possible to have the menus in Korean language in CDE. 

Installation of the messages 
----------------------------

To do that, make sure the ko_KR.euckr locale is installed with

 locale -a |grep ko_KR

If yes, check that the ksc5601.1987 fonts are present with 
 
 xlsfonts | grep ksc5601
 
The result of that command should show fonts such as 
 -daewoo-mincho-medium-r-normal--16-120-100-100-c-160-ksc5601.1987-0
 


Then copy catgen-kr.sh in a directory such as $HOME/bin and make it
executable 

 chmod +x $HOME/bin/catgen-kr.sh 
 cd $CDEROOT/programs/localized/ko_KR.euckr/msg 
 $HOME/bin/catgen-kr.sh 

The program will ask your password to copy the .cat files in the /usr/dt/lib/nls/msg
directory. This works on Ubuntu, but with Slackware or other systems not using
sudo you may need to remove the sudo command in the last line and become root
before running the script. 

Then, copy the font aliases file 

 sudo mkdir -p /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ko_KR/  
 sudo cp $CDEROOT/cdesktopenv-code/cde/programs/fontaliases/linux/ko_KR/fonts.alias /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/ 
 sudo echo "0" > /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ko_KR/fonts.dir


Once it it done, add the two lines
xset fp+ /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ko_KR/
export LANG=ko_KR.euckr

to $HOME/.dtprofile and restart CDE. With a default Slackware installation, messages and menubars appear in Korean. 

Action definitions, application defaults, configuration files
-------------------------------------------------------------
These files have to be produced by the merge program in 
$CDEROOT/programs/localized/util
from .nls files that contain the template, and .tmsg files 
that contain the Japanese text to fill that template. 
For convenience, the present directory contains all necessary files 
to regenerate the action definitions, application defaults and configuration
files as well as the generated files. 

To regenerate these files, edit genfiles.sh to point to the correct
CDEROOT location. Then, make the file executable and install it 
in $HOME/bin and run it in the present directory. 

If you want to regenerate from the CDE source
tree, you need first to create the .nls template files by symlink from
one of the default locales, following the model in the present directory. 
Then, you will have to run the script in the appropriate subdirectory. 

To install the action definitions, application defaults and config, use 
  sudo install.sh 
 in the present directory. 


Issue with fonts
-----------------

You may see instead of Korean characters in the menus some garbled text 
formed of European characters. This indicates that CDE does not find appropriate
fonts ksc5601.1987-0 and falls back to iso8859-1. 

You could also have only
a single possible size for the CDE fonts (this happens on Slackware). 

To solve that problem, you need to create/modify the fonts.alias file. 

You must have bitmapped fonts in ksc5601.1987-0 encoding with sizes 10,12,14,16,18,20,24.
For each size xxs (10), xs (12), s (14), m (16), l (18), xl (20), xxl (24) 
one needs to alias the fonts of type 
-dt-interface user-*
-dt-interface system-*
-dt-interface terminal-*
in both medium and bold to the correspondent system font in ksc5601.1987-0 encoding. 

The aliasing is done in the fonts.alias by writing on the left the (XLFD) name
of the CDE font, on the right the appropriate (XLFD) name for the system font. 
One example is: 
   CDE font                                                                   Korean system font
 "-dt-interface terminal-medium-r-normal-s-14-130-75-75-m-140-ksc5601.1987-0" "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-ksc5601.1987-0"
 
The file fonts.alias under /usr/dt/config/xfonts shows the pattern to follow


A more complicated way, if the above does not work, is to try to use XFT with CDE 

https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/FontsWithXFT/

One will still need to alias all the -dt-interface fonts to the corresponding 
scalable TrueType/OpenType fonts.
