By default, the Korean messages are not compiled and installed 
by the CDE build process. 
With GNU gencat, it is possible to build post-installation the 
Korean messages for the ko_KR.euckr locale and install them 
in the appropriate directory. With the right fonts, it should 
be possible to have the menus in Korean language in CDE. 

Installation of the messages 
----------------------------

To do that, make sure the ko_KR.euckr locale is installed with

 locale -a |grep ko_KR

If yes, check that the ksc5601.1987 fonts are present with 
 
 xlsfonts | grep ksc5601
 
The result of that command should show fonts such as 
 -daewoo-mincho-medium-r-normal--16-120-100-100-c-160-ksc5601.1987-0
 


Then copy catgen-kr.sh in a directory such as $HOME/bin and make it
executable 

 chmod +x $HOME/bin/catgen-kr.sh 
 cd $CDEROOT/programs/localized/ko_KR.euckr/msg 
 $HOME/bin/catgen-kr.sh 

The program will ask your password to copy the .cat files in the /usr/dt/lib/nls/msg
directory. This works on Ubuntu, but with Slackware or other systems not using
sudo you may need to remove the sudo command in the last line and become root
before running the script. 

Then, copy the font aliases file 

 sudo mkdir -p /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ko_KR/  
 sudo cp $CDEROOT/cdesktopenv-code/cde/programs/fontaliases/linux/ko_KR/fonts.alias /usr/dt/config/xfonts/zh_CH/ 
 sudo echo "0" > /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ko_KR/fonts.dir


Once it it done, add the two lines in dtprofile to $HOME/.dtprofile and restart 
CDE. 

Issue with fonts
-----------------

You may see instead of Korean characters in the menus some garbled text 
formed of European characters. This indicates that CDE does not find appropriate
fonts ksc5601.1987-0 and falls back to iso8859-1. 

To solve that problem, one needs to create a fonts.alias file using the template
fonts.alias. 

One must have bitmapped fonts in ksc5601.1987-0 encoding with sizes 10,12,14,16,18,20,24.
For each size xxs (10), xs (12), s (14), m (16), l (18), xl (20), xxl (24) 
one needs to alias the fonts of type 
-dt-interface user-*
-dt-interface system-*
-dt-interface terminal-*
in both medium and bold to the correspondent system font in ksc5601.1987-0 encoding. 

Then, the aliasing is done in the fonts.alias by writing on the left the (XLFD) name
of the CDE font, on the right the appropriate (XLFD) name for the system font. 
One example is: 
   CDE font                                                                   Korean system font
 "-dt-interface terminal-medium-r-normal-s-14-130-75-75-m-140-ksc5601.1987-0" "-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--14-130-75-75-c-140-ksc5601.1987-0"
 
The file fonts.alias under /usr/dt/config/xfonts shows the pattern to follow


I haven't been able to test that solution as my version of Linux does not
have all the necessary sizes in bitmapped fonts. 

A more complicated way, if the above does not work, is to try to use XFT with CDE 

https://sourceforge.net/p/cdesktopenv/wiki/FontsWithXFT/

One will still need to alias all the -dt-interface fonts to the corresponding 
scalable TrueType/OpenType fonts
