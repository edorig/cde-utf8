By default, the Japanese messages are not compiled and installed 
by the CDE build process. 
With GNU gencat, it is possible to build post-installation the 
Japanese messages for the ja_JP.eucjp locale and install them 
in the appropriate directory. 

To do that, make sure the ja_JP.eucjp locale is installed with

 locale -a |grep ja_JP

If yes, check that the JIS fonts are present with 
 
 xlsfonts | grep jis
 
The result of that command should show fonts 
 -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--10-96-75-75-c-120-jisx0208.1983-0
 -sony-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-120-100-100-c-80-jisx0201.1976-0
 
Finally, check that the directory /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ja_JP contains
the two files fonts.alias and fonts.dir 

 ls  /usr/dt/config/xfonts/ja_JP/fonts.*

Then copy catgen-jp.sh in a directory such as $HOME/bin and make it
executable 

 chmod +x $HOME/bin/catgen-jp.sh 
 cd $CDEROOT/programs/localized/ja_JP.eucjp/msg 
 $HOME/bin/catgen-jp.sh 

The program will ask your password to copy the .cat files in the /usr/dt/lib/nls/msg
directory. This works on Ubuntu, but with Slackware or other systems not using
sudo you may need to remove the sudo command in the last line and become root
before running the script. 

Once it it done, add the two lines in dtprofile to $HOME/.dtprofile to see
the CDE menus in Japanese. 

Action definitions, application defaults, configuration files
-------------------------------------------------------------
These files have to be produced by the merge program in 
$CDEROOT/programs/localized/util
from .nls files that contain the template, and .tmsg files 
that contain the Japanese text to fill that template. 
For convenience, the present directory contains all necessary files 
to regenerate the action definitions, application defaults and configuration
files as well as the generated files. 

To regenerate these files, edit genfiles.sh to point to the correct
CDEROOT location. Then, make the file executable and install it 
in $HOME/bin and run it in the present directory. 

If you want to regenerate from the CDE source
tree, you need first to create the .nls template files by symlink from
one of the default locales, following the model in the present directory. 
Then, you will have to run the script in the appropriate subdirectory. 

To install the messages, use 
  sudo install.sh
